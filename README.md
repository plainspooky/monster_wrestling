# Monster Wrestling

These are my versions for the game of the same name included
in the book **WEIRD COMPUTER GAMES**, published by [Usborne Publishing in
1983](https://usborne.com/browse-books/features/computer-and-coding-books/).
It was printed in Brazil the following year as **PROGRAMAS DE JOGOS DE TERROR**
by _Editora Lut√©cia_. All games in this book were written by Jenny Tyler and
Chris Oxlade using BBC BASIC (BBC Micro & Electron computers). In the book
there were extra instructions for modifying them to the Apple II, Commodore 64,
Commodore VIC-20, TRS-80 Color, and ZX Spectrum computers. In the Brazilian
edition all games were translated to TRS-80's BASIC (Level II BASIC) and
instructions to the IBM PC, MSX, ZX-81 and TK-2000 (MPF-II) computers added.
